The served files from [my webserver](https://github.com/Eliiia/)
Based slightly on [my old webserver](https://github.com/site-old/)'s served files

The reason this is seperated from the webserver, is that I will be constantly pushing small updates onto here, and I'd rather not flood the webserver with them
